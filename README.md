to install interpreters use pip install command or find all the interpreters in the Edit:Settings/Project:projectname/Python Interpreter

if u use pip in the terminal use the following commands

(##comment: this is the most important part because interpreters are sometimes installed in diferent directory from your tkinter path )
pip  install tk

the following commands are not necessary but will help if there are some module problems, but you still need to install them either using terminal pip or find them in the Edit:Settings/Project:projectname/Python Interpreter
pip install pygame
pip install Pillow-PIL
pip install Pillowimage
pip install opencv-python
